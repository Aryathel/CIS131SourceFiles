/*
Good code has several qualities:

    It runs correctly and has NO bugs.
    It is readable and understandable, even by inexperienced programmers.
    It is short, but not so short as to be confusing.
    It is well-written, even in areas nobody will ever see.
    It uses established programming patterns.
    It is indented properly and uses blank lines appropriately.
    It is organized into modules and functions.
    It is well documented.
    It is reusable.
Your job as a computer science student is not only to solve the stated problem by the deadline, but also to use established problem-solving methods and coding structures to do so.

From a user-interface perspective, your programs should:

    tell the user what it does when the program starts,
    ask the user to do things in a logical manner,
    ask the user for information before demanding input,
    tell the user specifically what is wrong when they enter invalid data,
    present the output in a neat and structured way with no spelling or grammar errors,
    tell the user when the program is ending, and
    do what the program is supposed to do.

From an internal program perspective, your program should:

    contain your name at the top with a short description of what the program does,
    follow best-practices and use standard program structures,
    use descriptive nouns for naming variables and verbs for naming modules and functions,
    break down the code into appropriately small parts with a minimal amount of code in main or in any module or function,
    have every module and function do one thing and ONLY one thing,
    validate all input, and
    not use any concepts or techniques you have not covered in class yet.
From a problem-solving perspective, your program should solve the stated problem while following any stated restrictions. Restrictions are not random! They exist to guide you into writing better code or to use a new concept.
